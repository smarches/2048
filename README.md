# 2048

It's a simple game wherein you smash together tiles. Each time tiles are smushed together, their values combine. Eventually, you can create a tile with value 2048. Then...well, then nothing special happens.

## Building

Uses Webpack 5:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Running

Run in browser with the files in `dist` folder (just open `2048.html`), or in the Node.js repl via `src/startup.js`.
